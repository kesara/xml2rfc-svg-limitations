1.  Introduction

   This draft explores limits of SVG artwork in [xml2rfc].  Text output
   of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs doesn't embed SVG artwork.  Only
   HTML and PDF formats embed SVG artwork.  Between those two formats,
   PDF is the deciding factor.  This is because of the limitations of
   the PDF rendering capabilities of [xml2rfc] tool.

   Note that PDF output will contain lot of empty spaces, this is on
   purpose to maximize the use of A4 size PDF page.

   PDF of rendering of this draft is available here
   (https://github.com/kesara/xml2rfc-svg-limitations/raw/main/draft-
   rathnayake-svg-limitations-00.pdf).

2.  SVG without figure caption

   This is an example of <artwork> without a <figure> element to add a
   caption.

   The example is generated with following XML.

   <artwork type="svg" name="max box">
     <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 900 1200">
       <rect x="0" y="0" width="900" height="1200" stroke="black"
         stroke-width="10" fill="none" />
     </svg>
   </artwork>

                   +--------+---------+----------------+
                   | Width  | Height  | viewBox Value  |
                   +--------+---------+----------------+
                   | 900 px | 1200 px | "0 0 900 1200" |
                   +--------+---------+----------------+

                                  Table 1

   (Artwork only available as SVG: see https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/
   draft-rathnayake-svg-limitations-00.html)

3.  SVG with figure caption

   This is an example of <artwork> with a <figure> element to add a
   caption.

   Note that the caption of the figure fits in to a single line in PDF
   format.  If the caption runs longer than a one line, adjust the
   height of SVG artwork accordingly.

   The example is generated with following XML.

   <figure>
     <name>SVG artwork with the caption</name>
     <artwork type="svg" name="max box">
       <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 900 1140">
         <rect x="0" y="0" width="900" height="1140" stroke="black"
           stroke-width="10" fill="none" />
       </svg>
     </artwork>
   </figure>

                   +--------+---------+----------------+
                   | Width  | Height  | viewBox Value  |
                   +--------+---------+----------------+
                   | 900 px | 1140 px | "0 0 900 1140" |
                   +--------+---------+----------------+

                                  Table 2

   draft-rathnayake-svg-limitations-00.html)

                   Figure 1: SVG artwork with the caption

4.  Testing PDF output

   The PDF files available in datatracker (https://datatracker.ietf.org)
   are different from PDF files published by RFC editor (https://rfc-
   editor.org) for published RFCs.  The correct PDF output for RFC must
   be produced with [xml2rfc].

   The PDF output of the I-Ds can be tested using [xml2rfc] with --pdf
   switch.

   Other option is to use [author-tools].  Use of of Author Tools for
   this is recommended because Author Tools contains the latest versions
   of all the tools and libraries and the required fonts
